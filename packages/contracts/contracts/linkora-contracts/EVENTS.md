# Kovara Social Contract - Event Schema

This document defines the canonical event schema for the Kovara Social contract. Indexers and clients should use this as the source of truth for decoding and filtering events.

## Versioning Strategy

All events follow a consistent topic structure:
`(ContractName, EventName, Version)`

- **ContractName**: `Kovara` (Symbol)
- **EventName**: Descriptive name (Symbol)
- **Version**: `v1`, `v2`, etc. (Symbol)

When a schema change is required, the version symbol will be incremented. Indexers should filter for the versions they support.

### ContractUpgraded

Emitted when the contract WASM is upgraded.

- **Topic 0**: `Kovara`
- **Topic 1**: `upgraded`
- **Topic 2**: `v1`
- **Data Payload**: `ContractUpgraded`
  - `new_wasm_hash`: `BytesN<32>`

#### Upgrade preconditions

`ContractUpgraded` is only emitted when all of the following hold:

1. The contract is **initialized** — the `ADMIN` key exists in instance storage.
   An uninitialized contract panics with `"not initialized"` before the event is
   published.
2. The caller is the **stored admin address** — `require_auth()` is satisfied.
   Any other caller is rejected before the event is published.
3. The `new_wasm_hash` refers to a WASM blob **already uploaded** to the Stellar
   ledger.  The Soroban host validates the hash; if no matching blob is found the
   host raises an error and the event is **not** committed to the ledger (it may
   appear only in the failed-diagnostic-events log).

Because event emission occurs inside the contract (before the host finalises the
WASM swap), a test environment with no uploaded WASM will show the event in
`env.events().all()` only if the panic is caught.  In production, the event is
committed only when the full transaction succeeds.

#### Invalid / missing WASM hash behaviour

| Supplied hash | Upload status | Outcome |
|---|---|---|
| Any `BytesN<32>` not in the ledger | Not uploaded | Host error; transaction fails; event **not** committed |
| `[0u8; 32]` (all zeros) | Never a real hash | Same as above |
| `[0xffu8; 32]` (all 0xff) | Never a real hash | Same as above |
| Hash returned by `stellar contract upload` | Uploaded | Transaction succeeds; event committed |

#### Monitoring recommendations

Indexers should subscribe to this event to detect unexpected upgrades:

- Alert if a `ContractUpgraded` event appears from an unknown admin address.
- Alert if the `new_wasm_hash` does not match the hash recorded in the release
  notes for the expected deployment.
- Record every upgrade with its ledger sequence number for audit purposes.

## Querying and Decoding

### Using Stellar CLI

To fetch events from a specific contract on Testnet:

```bash
stellar events --id <CONTRACT_ID> --network testnet --start-ledger <LEDGER_NUM>
```

To filter for only `tip` events:

```bash
stellar events --id <CONTRACT_ID> --network testnet --topic "Kovara, tip, v1"
```

### Using JS SDK

```javascript
const events = await server.getEvents({
  filters: [
    {
      type: "contract",
      contractIds: [CONTRACT_ID],
      topics: [
        [
          xdr.ScVal.scvSymbol("Kovara").toXDR("base64"),
          xdr.ScVal.scvSymbol("tip").toXDR("base64"),
          xdr.ScVal.scvSymbol("v1").toXDR("base64"),
        ],
      ],
    },
  ],
  startLedger: 123456,
});
```
